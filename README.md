## SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT

The intention of this project was to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as reddit) which should provide this information to the front end architecture.

This API is written using:
- `Node.js`
- `PostgreSQL` to create the database
- `jest`, `jest-sorted` and `supertest` for testing purposes


It aims to demonstrate the knowledge on:

- `Callback functions`,
- `RESTful endpoints`,
- `MVC Pattern (Model-View-Controller)`,
- `Use of routers`,
- `Advanced error handling`,
- `Seeding`,
- `Complex queries`.
